# Improved Countdowns

A modern, draggable countdown tracker for the Daggerheart system in Foundry VTT (v13+).

## Features

- **Modern UI**: A sleek, draggable window replacing the default system tracker.
- **Minimized View**: Toggle between a full view with names and icons, or a compact minimized view to save space.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - **Increase/Decrease**: Hover over countdowns to see `+` and `-` buttons for quick updates.
  - **Add New**: GMs can add new countdowns directly from the tracker.
  - **Lock/Unlock**: Lock the tracker's position to prevent accidental drags.
- **System Integration**: Fully compatible with the Daggerheart system's built-in countdown logic.
